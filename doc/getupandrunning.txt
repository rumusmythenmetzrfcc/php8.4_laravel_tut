---GENERAL SETUP WINDOWS---

php for windows is unpacked locally
ie. at C:\workspaces\s\m\l\php\php-8.4.5-nts-Win32-vs17-x64

C:\workspaces\s\m\l\php\php-8.4.5-nts-Win32-vs17-x64\php.ini.development is changed
mbstring uncomment
extension_dir uncomment

Install composer
https://getcomposer.org/download/

punit is the testing framework
Composer will be used to install punit
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\ComposerSetup\bin\composer
Inside the procject root:
composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit
composer dump-autoload
Generates
C:\workspaces\s\m\l\php\intellijipro\vendor\autoload.php
which loads
C:\workspaces\s\m\l\php\intellijipro\vendor\composer\autoload_real.php

PunitDoc:
https://docs.phpunit.de/en/12.0/installation.html#what-is-inside-the-phar


intelliji:
Install official Jetbrains PHP plugin
add php.ini and unpacked php.exe to php settings
located at C:\workspaces\s\m\l\php\php-8.4.5-nts-Win32-vs17-x64
add autoload.php path to intelliji->php/TestFrameworks (Composer Autoloader)
set php language level to 8.4
Tests run now

Optional:
You may add php to environment variable PATH
C:\workspaces\s\m\l\php\php-8.4.5-nts-Win32-vs17-x64
Or better have a bat file that just adds the PATH per cmd instance
see ./php8.4_cmd.bat
move the file to:
C:/workspaces/mybats/env/php8.4_cmd.bat
In Intelliji you can have a custom cmd version:
Terminal>Settings>shell_path
Short name php8.4_cmd.bat can be used as value if
you add i.e. C:/workspaces/mybats/env to PATH
